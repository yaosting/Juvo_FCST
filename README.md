# üóìÔ∏è  Milestone
#### 2019 - DSS + Sales Pattern
Starting from 2019, the sales forecasting system has been driven by DSS (Daily Selling Speed) and Sales Pattern.
DSS is a weighted average of historical sales over a certain period of time, with adjustments made for oversize orders and stockouts.
The sales pattern is a monthly-level historical observation of market trends at the product type level.
The monthly-level Sales Forecast is obtained by multiplying the product-level/channel-level DSS with the corresponding monthly-level Sales Pattern.

#### 2022 - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network
Starting from 2022 Q4, the sales forecasting system has been driven by MLP model.
The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is a feedforward neural network composed of multiple layers of neurons, with each layer connected to the next layer through fully connected connections.
It is a widely used artificial neural network model commonly employed for classification and regression problems, including image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.

#### 2023 Q1 - Neural Prophet
Starting from 2023 Q1, the sales forecasting system has been driven by NP (Neural Prophet) model. Our main upgrade is as follows:
Drive sales forecasting with NP algorithm.
Standardize the model and process for multi-channel sales forecasting.
Use dynamic Safety Stock instead of static Safety Stock parameters.
We achieved a 3% improvement in comparison to the MLP model by using historical averages.

#### 2023 Q2 - Neural Prophet + Cat Boost + MKT features
Starting from 2023 Q2, the sales forecasting system has been driven by NP (Neural Prophet) model and CB (Cat Boost) model.
Another main upgrade is as follows:
Outliers optimization: Better identification of sales impacts caused by out of stock, temporary promotions, and other factors.
Integration of Marketing (MKT) features, such as SEM cost, SEM CTR, product rank, coupon and return quantity.
We achieved a 2% improvement in comparison to the NP only model by using historical averages.

#### 2023 Q3 - Neural Prophet + Cat Boost + Feature 2.0
Starting from 2023 Oct 2nd, the sales forecasting system has been driven by Feature 2.0.
Another main upgrade is as follows:
More marketing information such as price, competitors and promotions has been added.
More comprehensive and accurate anomaly detection for historical sales


# üéØÔ∏è Measurement

# üí¨ FAQ
#### What is the commercial value of 70% FA?
We will know in advance about 70% of the sales situation in the next three months, Which products will be sold in what channels and times, and how many quantities
#### Conditions for the release and launch of System FCST
Calculate the FA and FB corresponding to the Ongoing and All pools of M0~M2 and M1~M3 for at least 4 historical versions of System FCST
The average FA of the development version in the M0-M2 caliber is better than that of the production version
The average FA of the development version in the M1~M3 caliber is better than that of the production version
The FB of the development version in the M0-M2 caliber is within -10%~10%
The FB of the development version in the M1~M3 caliber is within -10%~10%, but one version is allowed to exceed the 10% threshold for FB
#### Why choose NP (Neural Prophet) model ?
Neural Prophet is a neural network-based time series forecasting model developed by Meta (Facebook) as an open-source model.
NP can model and accurately forecast time series data by decomposing it into trend and seasonal components.
Considering data availability and quality, NP's time series modeling approach is more suitable when only stable sales and inventory time series data are available.
#### How to use NP ?
Conduct stationarity test on time series and process non-stationary sequences.
Input processed time series into NP model to learn multi-dimensional growth trends, seasonal trends, etc.
Adjust model structure and customize technical parameters like Fourier terms and time series decomposition.
Conduct multi-step prediction based on time series characteristics learned by the model.
#### Why choose CB (CatBoost) model ?
CB (CatBoost or Categorical Boosting) is a gradient boosting framework developed by Yandex.
CB supports constructing complex feature space to discover feature correlations and contributions to the target.
GBDT can provide feature importance measurement and interpretability to identify key influencing factors.
CB has rapid training and can quickly respond to recent business changes.
#### How to use CB ?
Construct multidimensional features representing recent business factors.
Apply GBDT to learn feature relationships and contributions.
Parameter optimization via grid search and cross validation.
Apply optimized model to forecast recent sequence changes.
#### Why do we need feature engineering in FCST ?
Improve accuracy: Feature engineering can help models better understand data and improve prediction accuracy.
Enhance interpretability: Proper feature engineering can make some models more interpretable, helping teams understand model decision processes.
Leverage expert knowledge: Manual FCST considers more factors, integrating experts' knowledge and experience. Through feature engineering, we can incorporate such knowledge into system FCST.
Increase model robustness: Feature engineering can help models become more robust towards new, unseen data and enhance stability.
Learn from manual FCST logic: We hope system FCST can learn and apply logics from manual FCST. Feature engineering ensures models can learn and apply such logic.
#### What features have we considered in FCST ?
In feature engineering v2.0 we have cumulatively added data of inventory, SEM, price, seasonality, competitors.
Overall, our feature engineering is continuously enriching and upgrading from simple to complex, low-dimensional to high-dimensional, which will greatly enhance model predictive power. Please refer to the feature engineering section for details.

#### Why do we need our own data science team for in-house FCST development ?
**Customized prediction**:<br>
In-house research and development can design personalized predictive models based on enterprise proprietary data and business models, which ready-made generic tools cannot achieve.<br>
**Data security and risk control:** <br>
In-house R&D helps protect core data privacy, reduce reliance on external suppliers, and mitigate data control risks.<br>
**Continuous optimization and cost control:** <br>
The internal team can continuously optimize models based on business needs and effectively control predictive costs. Outsourced black-box systems lack flexibility and incur higher costs.<br>
